# Skirk Marble - FORK SUMMARY

This Blue Marble fork adds several improvements focused on user experience and productivity for wplace.live.

## Installation

**Important:** Remove the original Blue Marble before installing Skirk Marble to avoid conflicts between scripts.

## Individual Color Progress

View the specific progress of each color in your template. Each color shows how many pixels have been painted, how many are wrong, and how many still need to be completed.

### Corner Borders

## Pause Tiles

Completely freeze the canvas to eliminate 100% of lag during painting. When activated, the template stays static and doesn't update, providing maximum performance. Reactivate when necessary to see real-time updates.

## Location System

### Location Search
Search for any location in the world and navigate directly to it on the map.

### Custom Favorites
Save important locations by pasting wplace.live links or entering coordinates manually. Ideal for marking work areas, specific projects, or reference points.
